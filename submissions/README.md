# ICP Development Environment with Azle and React

This template gives you everything you need to build a full-stack Web3 application on the [Internet Computer](https://internetcomputer.org/).
It includes a frontend built with Vite and React, and a backend written in JS/TS (Azle).

## Get started with one click:
### In your browser:

In Gitpod 

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/fxgst/azle-react/)

or GitHub Codespaces

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/fxgst/azle-react/?quickstart=1)


### Locally:

Make sure you have you have the latest version of Docker (e.g. >25) and VS Code installed and running, then click the button below

## üöÄ Develop

When the editor opened, run the following commands to deploy the canisters and start a development server:

```sh
npm install # Install project dependencies
dfx deploy # Deploy canisters locally

npm start # Start the development server
```

The frontend will update automatically as you save changes. 
For the backend, run `dfx deploy backend` to redeploy.
To redeploy all canisters (front- and backend), run `dfx deploy`.

When ready, run `dfx deploy --network ic` to deploy your application to the ICP mainnet.

## üí° Tips and Tricks

- If the links printed by dfx do not work in Codespaces, run `./canister_urls.py` and click the links shown there.
- If you get an error "Error: An error happened during communication with the replica: ... Connection refused", run `dfx start --clean --background` to start dfx
