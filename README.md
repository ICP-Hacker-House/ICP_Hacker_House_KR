## Description

DUGUP is not a Fan to Earn but a Fan to Grow Artist social-fi app. The KPOP community has shown the power to elevate BTS to the top of the Billboard charts. This growth is driven not by agency plans but by fan engagement, creating artists together. Dugup is designed so that fans' engagement contributes to the growth of artists.
